Create code that can automatically exploit its documented vulnerabilities.
Understanding the project 
Creating code which exploits vulnerabilities of a system-XSS attack and CSRF attack. I’m going to create a website which is going to be a documentation of the project.
Purpose of CI automation
An automation process that streamlines the process of integrating code changes made to a shared repository (so improves collaboration) and verifying its correctness. Example- multiple developers working on a project, they make changes to the code independently and CI automation allows them to integrate changes, detects any issues (as it automatically tests the codebase whenever changes are made) and reduces likelihood of bugs etc. 
How does one achieve CI automation using Git Hub(GH) actions- creating a job on github (which allows you to deploy the website so it automatically updated).

Purpose of Hugo
Instead of developing code to build a website, we can use Hugo which is a static site generator that has the framework of a website built for us. In summary, it is a tool that simplifies the process of creating websites with minimal complexity.
Static site generator- this is able to take your content and generate a complete website. It differs from a dynamic website because it does not rely on ‘server side processing or databases to generate web pages’
